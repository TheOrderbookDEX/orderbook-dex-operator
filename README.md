## What is this?

This is the package for the **Operator** smart contract of *The Orderbook DEX*.

The **Operator** is a smart contract created and owned by the user to act on behalf of the user to execute trade operations on an **Orderbook** smart contract.

## What else is here?

* An **OperatorFactory** to create and upgrade **Operators**.
* An **OperatorBase** that all operator implementations should extend.
* An **OperatorERC20** implementation for ERC20 functionality.
